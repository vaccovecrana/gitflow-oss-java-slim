# Org Config / Project bootstrap cheat-sheet

The previous sections outlined the concepts and structure behind this framework.

The following is a quick walk-through on how to create an Org config from scratch, and configure a single Gradle project to adhere to it. In this example, only external OSS publication support is enabled.

Start by creating an Org config template, filling in required parameters:

```json
{
  "orgId": "my-org-id",
  "snapshotsRepo": {
    "id": "SonatypeOSSSnapshots",
    "url": "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/",
    "usernameEnvProperty": "SONATYPE_USER",
    "passwordEnvProperty": "SONATYPE_PASSWORD"
  },
  "releasesRepo": {
    "id": "SonatypeOSSStaging",
    "url": "https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2/",
    "usernameEnvProperty": "SONATYPE_USER",
    "passwordEnvProperty": "SONATYPE_PASSWORD"
  },
  "publishing": {
    "id": "an Org id (for example yoyodyne)",
    "devId": "a dev id (for example jhacker)",
    "devContact": "an Org name (for example Yoyodyne, Inc. or James Hacker)",
    "devEmail": "jhacker@yoyodyne.com",
    "mavenSigningKeyEnvProperty": "MAVEN_SIGNING_PRV"
  },
  "devConfig": {
    "gradleVersion": "7.0",
    "gradleDistribution": "https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.0-bin.zip",
    "jdkDistribution": "https://api.adoptopenjdk.net/v3/binary/latest/11/ga/linux/x64/jdk/hotspot/normal/adoptopenjdk",
    "versions": {
      "j8Spec": "io.github.j8spec:j8spec:3.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

Next, go to the [Github Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) section of your repository, and configure the following values:

- `SONATYPE_USER` - your Sonatype OSS repository username.
- `SONATYPE_PASSWORD` - your Sonatype OSS account password.
- `MAVEN_SIGNING_PRV` - An ASCII armoured version of you Maven PGP signin key.

You can export the PGP private key intended to sign releases with the following command:

```
gpg --output private.pgp --armor --export-secret-key jhacker@yoyodyne.com
```

> Note: In general, it should be safe to export subkeys derived from a PGP master private key. By consequence, it is never recommended that you store a master private key as a Github Secret to sign Maven artifacts.

Set the values required, and upload this to an S3 bucket, Dropbox or a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Keep the URL where you uploaded this configuration.

## Local development configuration

On your local development machine, create a file called `.gsOrgConfig.json` inside your home folder. Include the following contents:

```json
{
  "orgId": "my-org-id",
  "orgConfigUrl": "https://<Location where you uploaded the Org Config file>"
}
```

## Gradle Project setup

Next, switch over to the project you'd like to manage with this framework, and set:

`.github/workflows/main.yml`

```yaml
name: Gradle Build
on: {push: {tags: null}}
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: vaccovecrana/gitflow-oss-java-slim@{{gsVersion}}
        with:
          orgConfig: https://<Location where you uploaded the Org Config file>
        env:
          SONATYPE_USER: <secrets.MY_ORGS_SONATYPE_USER>
          SONATYPE_PASSWORD: <secrets.MY_ORGS_SONATYPE_PASSWORD>
          MAVEN_SIGNING_PRV: <secrets.MY_ORGS_MAVEN_SIGNING_KEY>
```

`gradle.properties`:

```ini
libGitUrl=https://github.com/my-org/my-project.git
libDesc=This is a brief description of what my library does
libLicense=Apache License, Version 2.0 (choose a license)
libLicenseUrl=https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0 (a link to your license text)
```

Finally, include and configure the Gradle plugin in your source tree in `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
plugins { id("io.vacco.oss.gitflow") version "{{gsVersion}}" }

group = "com.myorg.mylibrary" // your project's target maven coordinates.
version = "0.1.0" // or whichever version you have

configure<io.vacco.oss.gitflow.GsPluginProfileExtension> {
  sharedLibrary(false, true) // external library with publication support
  addJ8Spec()
  addClasspathHell()
}
```

Once this is done, the following managed builds will take place:

- Committing a `feature/XYZ` branch will produce and upload `SNAPSHOT` artifact into the Sonatype OSS snapshots repository. One such branch could be named `feature/performance-improvements`.
- Committing into the `develop` branch will build and upload a `MILESTONE` artifact into the Sonatype OSS snapshots repository.
- Creating a tag out from `master` or `main` will build and upload a `RELEASE` artifact into the Sonatype OSS releases repository. Once you close and release the temporary repository, the artifact will be available in Maven Central.
