`gitflow-oss-java-slim`  is a minimal, opinionated java Continuous Integration framework which uses Gradle and Github Actions to support a simplified version of the Gitflow development model.

It is primarily targeted towards Open source Java developers and organizations that need to manage the complexity of building, versioning and releasing binary code artifacts.

With release `1.0.0`, we lay Java 8 to rest, put Java 11 to the test.
