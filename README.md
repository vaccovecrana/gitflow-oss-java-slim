`gitflow-oss-java-slim`  is a minimal, opinionated java Continuous Integration framework which uses Gradle and Github Actions to support a simplified version of the Gitflow development model.

It is primarily targeted towards Open source Java developers and organizations that need to manage the complexity of building, versioning and releasing binary code artifacts.

Documentation is available at https://vaccovecrana.github.io/gitflow-oss-java-slim/ and gets generated using `mdbook`.
